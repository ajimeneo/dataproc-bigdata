You are going to find five types of content in this book: Articles
I wrote, links to my podcast episodes (video & audio), more than 200
links to helpful websites I like, data engineering interview questions
and case studies.

Data Engineer vs Data Scientist

| Podcast Episode: #050 Data Engineer, Scientist or Analyst - Which One Is For You?
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| In this podcast we talk about the diï¬€erences between data scientists, analysts and engineers. Which are the three main data science jobs. All three are super important. This makes it easy to decide

### Data Engineer

Data Engineers are the link between the management's data strategy
and the data scientists that need to work with data.

What they do is building the platforms that enable data scientists to do
their magic.

These platforms are usually used in five different ways:

-   Data ingestion and storage of large amounts of data

-   Algorithm creation by data scientists

-   Automation of the data scientist's machine learning models and
    algorithms for production use

-   Data visualization for employees and customers

-   Most of the time these guys start as traditional solution architects
    for systems that involve SQL databases, web servers, SAP
    installations and other "standard" systems.
