## What is this Cookbook

This book is intended to be a proof of concept to spin up a fully bigdata ecosystem cluster from scratch. 

We will suck data from online real data from the city of Santander, available to us through the Smart City web page, and pour it into our system, enhanced with nifi,kafka and elasticsearch, and doing some visual presentations with kibana.

At the same time we will be able to interact with the system in real time with zeppelin notebooks.

In this cookbook we will cover all Data Engeneering platform key areas (Connect, Buffer, Processing Framework, Store, Visualize)
