## What is this Cookbook

I get asked a lot:
"What do you actually need to learn to become an awesome data engineer?"

Well, look no further. you'll find it here!

If you are looking for AI algorithms and such data scientist things,
this book is not for you.

**How to use this Cookbook:**
This book is intended to be a proof of concept to spin up a fully bigdata ecosystem cluster from scratch. We will suck data from online real data from the city of Santander, available to us through the Smart City web page, and pour it into our system, enhanced with nifi,kafka and elasticsearch, doing the presentations with kibana and interacting with the system with zeppelin notebooks.

In this cookbook we will cover all Data Engeneering platform key areas (Connect, Buffer, Processing Framework, Store, Visualize)

Start Zookeeper container for Kafka:

    docker run -d --name zookeeper-server   \
        --network app-tier   \
        -e ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LOGIN=yes    \
        bitnami/zookeeper:latest

Start Kafka container:

    docker run -d --name kafka-server  \
        --network app-tier  \
        -e KAFKA_CFG_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper-server:2181  \
        -e ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER=yes  \
