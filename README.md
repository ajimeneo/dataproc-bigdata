## What is this Cookbook

I get asked a lot:
"What do you actually need to learn to become an awesome data engineer?"

Well, look no further. you'll find it here!

If you are looking for AI algorithms and such data scientist things,
this book is not for you.

**How to use this Cookbook:**
This book is intended to be a starting point for you. It is not a training! I want to help you to identify the topics to look into and becoming an awesome data engineer in the process.

It hinges on my Data Science Platform Blueprint, check it out below. Once you understand it, you can find in the book tools that fit into each key area of a Data Science platform (Connect, Buffer, Processing Framework, Store, Visualize).

Select a few tools you are interested in, research and work with them.

Don't learn everything in this book! Focus.

**What types of content are in this book?**
You are going to find five types of content in this book: Articles
I wrote, links to my podcast episodes (video & audio), more than 200
links to helpful websites I like, data engineering interview questions
and case studies.

**This book is a work in progress!**
As you can see, this book is not finished. I'm constantly adding new
stuff and doing videos for the topics. But obviously, because I do this
as a hobby my time is limited. You can help making this book even
better.

**Help make this book awesome!**

#### KAFKA Commands

Start Zookeeper container for Kafka:

    docker run -d --name zookeeper-server   \
        --network app-tier   \
        -e ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LOGIN=yes    \
        bitnami/zookeeper:latest

Start Kafka container:

    docker run -d --name kafka-server  \
        --network app-tier  \
        -e KAFKA_CFG_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper-server:2181  \
        -e ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER=yes  \
