**What types of content are in this book?**
You are going to find five types of content in this book: Articles
I wrote, links to my podcast episodes (video & audio), more than 200
links to helpful websites I like, data engineering interview questions
and case studies.

**This book is a work in progress!**
As you can see, this book is not finished. I'm constantly adding new
stuff and doing videos for the topics. But obviously, because I do this
as a hobby my time is limited. You can help making this book even
