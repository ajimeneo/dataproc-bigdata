Once we have set up the datproc cluster and all containers are up and running ( nifi, zookeeper, kafka, elasticsearch and kibana) it's time to have a hands-on approach.

This is the architecture we have built up:

## Creating a flow with nifi

Nifi web page is listening on port 8060 and we have to access it through a SSH tunnel. As we have explained on the previous section [Setting up the cluster](01-BuildingUp.md#Create-a-SSH-tunnel-to-the-VM-instance-(master-node)), let's dive into nifi.

Nifi is very powerful ETL tool that allows as to ingest massive data from any endpoint in a visual fashion. Everything is designed from a process-flow perspective. Data ingested into the pipeline is convert into Flowfiles which are the piece of data we are manipulating. Processes define actions over these Flowfiles.

So processes are the pieces we are going to define once we drag them into the canvas.

Let's jump into it!

### Create a Process Group

Drag and drop a Process Group into the canvas.
